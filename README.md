# Dynamic E-commerce Platform with React.js and Strapi

This project is an e-commerce platform developed using React.js for the front end and Strapi for the back end. The data is managed using a MySQL database, and design elements have been implemented using Sass, giving the interface a visually pleasing and functional aesthetic which is also responsive to all screen sizes.

The primary feature of the application is the product page, which provides an extensive display of product information - including descriptions, images, and pricing. Products are further organized into categories and subcategories for better user navigation.

An attention-grabbing feature is the automatic slider that updates every seven seconds. Coupled with a navigational bar and dedicated tabs for featured and trending posts.

The platform also includes dynamic pricing functions. Discounts can be set on products, or badges can be added to denote new items.

One essential feature is the shopping cart system, allowing users to manage their product selections conveniently. The integration of Strapi, a headless CMS, supports efficient content management on the platform, permitting the addition, editing, or deletion of items, categories, subcategories and variable tags.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktayshakirov/online-store.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Directory

Navigate into the cloned repository's directory:

```bash
cd online-store
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies for React App

Install the necessary dependencies for the React app:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 4: Connecting your database to the environment

Create a file .env in the main folder of your application

```bash
# Local Server Configuration

VITE_APP_API_TOKEN=*Place your API key generated py Strapi here*
VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:1337/api
VITE_APP_UPLOAD_URL=http://localhost:5173/api/public
```

```bash
# # Remote Server Configuration

VITE_APP_API_TOKEN=*Place your API key generated py Strapi here*
VITE_APP_API_URL=*Your server URL*
VITE_APP_UPLOAD_URL=http://*server URL*/api/public
```

You can also fetch the images for the products locally

```bash
VITE_APP_UPLOAD_URL=/Watches
```

### Step 5: Navigate to the API Directory

Navigate to the Strapi app, which is in the /api directory within the project:

```bash
cd api
```

### Step 6: Install Dependencies for Strapi App

Install the necessary dependencies for the Strapi app:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 7: Setup Strapi

Follow the instructions in the Strapi documentation to set up your Strapi CMS. You will need to create an .env file in the root of your Strapi directory (/api) and add your database connection string and other environment-specific variables.

To start the React app, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

To start the Strapi app, navigate to its directory (/api) and run:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

### Step 8: Connecting your database to Strapi

Create .env file in /api and set it accordingly to your database

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS=
API_TOKEN_SALT=
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT=
# Database
DATABASE_CLIENT=mysql
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_NAME=watch_store
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=
DATABASE_SSL=false
JWT_SECRET=
```

Now, you should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.
