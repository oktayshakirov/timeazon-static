# Static E-commerce Platform with React.js

This project presents a static version of a fullstack e-commerce platform, designed with React.js for the front end and using Strapi.js for the backend. Intended for demonstration purposes, this version operates entirely as a frontend application, sourcing its data directly from a JavaScript file, eliminating the need for backend operations. The static version provides a glimpse into the capabilities of the full-fledged platform, offering a fast, lightweight and offline-capable alternative for showcases or demos.

Responsive Interface: Crafted with Sass, the platform's design is not only visually appealing but also fluidly adjusts to all screen sizes.
An attention-grabbing feature is the automatic slider that updates every seven seconds. Coupled with a navigational bar and dedicated tabs for featured and trending posts.

The primary feature of the application is the product page, which provides an extensive display of product information - including descriptions, images, and pricing. Products are further organized into categories and subcategories for better user navigation.

Essential feature is the shopping cart system, allowing users to manage their product selections conveniently. The integration of Strapi, a headless CMS, supports efficient content management on the platform, permitting the addition, editing, or deletion of items, categories, subcategories and variable tags.
